# Systematic Debugging Process

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This is a FAKE memory file with placeholder content. You MUST replace this entirely with your actual debugging methodology documentation. Do not use any of the lorem ipsum content below.

## Lorem Debugging Principles

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur debugging elit. Never debug what you can't reproduce, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt.

## Ipsum Process Steps

1. **Lorem Verification**: Verify bug exists in clean lorem environment
2. **Ipsum Minimization**: Reduce to smallest failing ipsum
3. **Dolor Hypothesis**: Form 3 hypotheses about dolor cause
4. **Amet Testing**: Design experiments consectetur adipiscing
5. **Elit Documentation**: Keep debugging lorem log

## Common Lorem Mistakes
- Changing multiple ipsums at once
- Assuming dolor without verifying
- Fixing symptoms amet consectetur
- Not checking if ipsum actually works
- Forgetting to test edge lorem cases

### Lorem Ipsum Example
```
Lorem: User reports button not working
Ipsum: Cannot reproduce in dev environment
Dolor: Check browser console for errors
Amet: Found undefined variable in production only
```
