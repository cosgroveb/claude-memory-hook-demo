# Claude Memory Hook Demo

A minimal example of selective memory loading for Claude Code using hooks.

Instead of loading all memory you might need for any and all tasks into every
Claude session (burning thousands of tokens), this hook lets you select only the
relevant memories when you start working. Hopefully your claude session is more
productive.

## Setup

```bash
make install
```

This will:
- Create `~/.claude/hooks/` and `~/.claude/memories/` directories
- Copy the hook scripts and make them executable
- Copy the settings.json configuration

Then add your own memory files to `~/.claude/memories/`

**NB**: It is critical to know these are intentionally examples and
`~/.claude/memories` should be fully replaced by your docs, your team's or org's docs.

## How It Works

When you first interact with Claude in a new session:
1. A tmux popup appears showing available memories
2. Use TAB to select relevant ones, ENTER to confirm
3. Claude receives only the selected context

## Requirements

- tmux (version 3.2+)
- fzf
- zsh

## Directory Structure

This is a minimal sample generated by documentation used for
various topics. These are only examples and they are intentionally limited and
minimal. Imagine, though, a team with varied enough responsibilities to have
5-10x of memories.
