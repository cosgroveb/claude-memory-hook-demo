# Claude Memory Hook Demo

A minimal example of selective memory loading for Claude Code using hooks.

Instead of loading all technical documentation into every Claude session (burning
thousands of tokens), this hook lets you select only the relevant memories when
you start working. Hopefully your claude session is more productive.

## Setup

1. Copy the `.claude` directory structure to your home directory
2. Make the hook executable: `chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/session-start-memory-check.zsh`
3. Add your own memory files to `~/.claude/memories/`

**NB**: It is critical to know these are intentionally examples and
`~/.claude/memories` should be fully replaced by your docs, your team's or org's docs.

## How It Works

When you first interact with Claude in a new session:
1. A tmux popup appears showing available memories
2. Use TAB to select relevant ones, ENTER to confirm
3. Claude receives only the selected context

## Requirements

- tmux (version 3.2+)
- fzf
- zsh

## Directory Structure

This is a minimal sample generated by documentation used by Braintree for
various topics. These are only examples and they are intentionally limited and
minimal. Imagine, though, a team with varied enough responsibilities to have
5-10x of memories.
